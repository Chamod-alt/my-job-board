âœ… FIX INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRISMA CLIENT ERROR

1. Open terminal in this project root (where package.json is located).
2. Run the following commands:

   npm install
   npx prisma generate

These steps will install all dependencies and generate the Prisma client, fixing this error:
"Cannot find module '.prisma/client/default'"

If you want to apply migrations and set up the database (after defining your schema):

   npx prisma migrate dev --name init

Make sure your `.env` file contains the correct DATABASE_URL.
